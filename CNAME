To turn your project into a site and add it to a custom domain, you can use GitHub Pages. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** for your project if you haven't already.
2. **Push your project** to the GitHub repository.
3. **Configure GitHub Pages** to serve your site from the repository.
4. **Add a CNAME file** to link your custom domain.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Initialize it with a README if you want.
   - **Note**: For GitHub Pages to work, your repository can be either public or private. However, if it is private, only you and your collaborators will be able to see the site.

2. **Push Your Project to GitHub**:
   - Initialize a local git repository if you haven't already:
     ```sh
     git init
     ```
   - Add your remote repository:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
     ```
   - Add, commit, and push your code:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push -u origin master
     ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Select the source branch (e.g., `master` or `main`) and the folder (e.g., `/root` or `/docs`).
   - Save the settings.

4. **Add a CNAME File**:
   - Create a `CNAME` file in the root of your repository with your custom domain.
